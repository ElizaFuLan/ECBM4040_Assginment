Indeed, they are generalized from the $L^2$ norm.\n","\n","For a real number $p \\ge 1$, the p-norm ($L^p$ norm) of vector $x$ is defined as:\n","$$\n","\\|x\\|_p = (|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dots + |x_n|^p)^{1/p}\n","$$\n","\n","One can see that for $p = 2$, we get the $L^2$/Euclidean norm.\n","\n","In this course, we will also encounter the $L^1$ norm.
