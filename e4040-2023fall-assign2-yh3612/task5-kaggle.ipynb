    "1. Unzip zip files in GCP or acquire administrator permission for other application installation. When you upload your dataset to your vm instances, you may want to unzip your files. However, unzip command is not built in. To use `sudo apt install unzip` or for future applications installation, you need to: \n",
    "  - Login as `ecbm4040` as is exampled [in the tutorial](https://ecbme4040.github.io/2023_fall/EnvSetup/gcp.html#2_Connect_to_your_instance_22)\n",
    "  - Run `sudo apt install unzip`\n",
    "  - You might experience different errors on this step, e.g.\n",
    "    - Permission Denied: Command `apt(-get)` will only run with `sudo` or under `root`. Don't forget the `sudo` prefix or switch to root by `sudo su`.\n",
    "    - Require password: Change Linux username **before** SSH login as is exampled in the tutorial. If you do `su ecbm4040` after SSH login with other users, you will need password to use `sudo`.\n",
    "    - Resource Temporarily Unavailable: Restart the VM or kill the processes occupying the resource. Google for solutions or refer to [this link](https://itsfoss.com/could-not-get-lock-error/) for details.\n",
    "    - Others: Google for solutions or contact TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you meet kernel crash (or the running never ends), you might consider using a larger memory CPU.Especially if you include large network structure like VGG, 15GB memory or more CPU is recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some python libraries that you might need to install first include pandas, scikit-learn. there are **2 OPTIONS** that you can use to install them:\n",
    "  - In the envTF24 environment in linux interface, type: `pip install [PACKAGE]` \n",
    "  - In the jupyter notebook (i.e. this file), type `!pip install [PACKAGE]`. Sometimes you need to restart the virtual environment or even the instance to get these packages functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You might need extra pip libraries to handle dataset, include network, etc. You can follow step 3 to install them."
